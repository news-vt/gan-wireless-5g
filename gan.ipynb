    "In this work we use raw signal data, which takes the form of complex numbers (called \"IQ\"). However, a currently limitation of TensorFlow models is that they cannot accept complex data as input. The reason for this is because values must be *ordered* for their gradient to exist, which is true for real numbers, and false for complex numbers. Therefore, we convert the IQ data into `magnitude` and `phase` features, which are real-valued elements."
